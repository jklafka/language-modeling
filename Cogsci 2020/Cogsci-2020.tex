\begin{abstract}
What role does communicative efficiency play in how we organize our
utterances? In this paper, we present a novel method of examining how
much information speakers in a given language communicate in each word,
surveying numerous diverse languages. We find that speakers produce
frequent and informative words at regular parts of their utterances,
depending on language they use. The information distribution for each
language is derived in part from the features and genealogy of the
language. This robust information distribution characterizes both spoken
and written communication, and emerges in children's earliest
utterances. However, in real-time communication, in-context word
predictability allows listeners to process information at a constant,
optimal rate, regardless of the information distribution in the language
they understand.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

We use language for a variety of purposes like greeting friends, making
records, and signaling group identity. But, these purposes all share a
common goal: Transmitting information that changes the mental state of
the listerner or reader (Austin, 1975). For this reason, language can be
thought of as a code, one that allows speakers to turn their intended
meaning into a message that can be transmitted to a listener or reader,
and subsequently converted by the listener back into an approximation of
the intended meaning (Shannon, 1948). How should we expect this code to
be structured?

If language has evolved to be a code for information transmission, its
structure should reflect this process of optimization (Anderson \&
Milson, 1989). The optimal code would have to work with two competing
pressures: (1) For listeners to easily and successfully decode messages
sent by the speaker, and (2) For speakers to easily code their messages
and transmit them with minimal effort and error. A fundamental
constraint on both of these processes is the linear order of spoken
language--sounds are produced one at a time and each is unavailable
perceptually once it is no longer being produced.

Humans accomodate this linear order constraint through incremental
processing. People process speech continuously as it arrives, predicting
upcoming words and building expectations about the likely meaning of
utterances in real-time rather than at their conclusion (Kutas \&
Federmeier, 2011; Pickering \& Garrod, 2013; Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton,
Eberhard, \& Sedivy, 1995). Since prediction errors can lead to severe
processing costs and difficulty integrating new information on the part
of listeners, speakers should seek to minimize prediction errors.
However, the cost of producing more predictable utterances is using more
words. Thus, the optimal strategy for speakers seeking to minimize their
production costs is to produce utterances that are just at the
prediction capacity of listeners without exceeding this capacity (Aylett
\& Turk, 2004; Genzel \& Charniak, 2002). In other words, speakers
should maintain a constant rate information of as close to the
listener's fastest decoding rate as possible.

This Uniform Information Density hypothesis has found support at a
variety of levels of language from the structure of individual words, to
the syntactic structure of utterances (Jaeger \& Levy, 2007; Piantadosi,
Tily, \& Gibson, 2011; see Gibson et al., 2019 for a review). Further,
speakers make lexical choices that smooth out the information in their
utterances (Jaeger \& Levy, 2007; Mahowald, Fedorenko, Piantadosi, \&
Gibson, 2013). However, while speakers can control which of several
near-synonyms they produce, or whether to produce an optional
complementizer like ``that,'' they cannot control the grammatical
properties of their native language like canonical word order that
impose top-down constraints on the structure of utterances. While
speakers may produce utterances as uniform in information density as
their languages will allow, these top-down constraints may impose
significant variation.

How significant are these top-down constraints? One previous paper
analyzed the information content in English sentences and found a
surprising three-step shape where information first rises, then plateus,
and then sharply rises again at the ends of sentences (Yu, Cong, Liang,
\& Liu, 2016). We build on these ideas, asking (1) Whether this shape
depends on listener's predictive models, (2) Whether this shape varies
across linguistic contexts, and (3) Whether this shape is broadly
characteristic of a diverse set of languages or varies predictably from
language to language. We find that languages are characterized by
highly-reliable but cross-linguisticly variable structures that co-vary
with typological features, but that predictive coding flattens these
shapes across languages, in accord with predictions of the Uniform
Information Density hypothesis.

\hypertarget{study-1-information-in-written-english}{%
\section{Study 1: Information in Written
English}\label{study-1-information-in-written-english}}

The Uniform Information Density Hypothesis predicts that people should
structure their utterances so that the amount of information in each
unit of language remains constant. An influentual early test of this
idea was performed by Genzel \& Charniak (2002) who analyzed the amount
of information in successive paragraphs of the same text. They found
that the amount of information increased across paragraphs when each was
considered in isolation. They reasoned that since all prior paragraphs
provide the context for reading each new paragraph, the amount of total
information (context + paragraph) was constant for human readers.

Yu et al. (2016) applied this same logic to analysis of the information
in individual sentences, computing the entropy of each successive word
in an utterance. Surprisingly, they found found a distinctive three-step
distribution for information in a corpus of written English. The first
word of each sentence tended to contain little information; words in the
middle of sentences each contained roughly the same amount of
information, nut the final word of each sentence contained much more
information than any other word. They found the same distribution across
sentence lengths, from sentences with \(15\) words to sentences with
\(45\) words. They took this as evidence against the Uniform Information
Density Hypothesis as, unlike Genzel and Charniak's (2002) results,
information plateud in the middle of sentences rather than increasing as
it did at the beginnings and ends.

We replicate their analysis here, bringing it more in line with Genzel
and Charniak's (2002) methods. While Yu et al. (2016) considered only
the information in each word, we build two different models. The first,
replicating their analysis, considers the surprisal of each word read in
isolation. The second, following Genzel \& Charniak (2002), is a trigram
model which considers the surprisal of each word having read the prior
two words. We take this trigram model as a better proxy for human
reader's processing of these sentences. We also develop a method for
averaging the curves for sentences of different lenghts together to
provide a single typical information curve signature.

\hypertarget{corpus}{%
\subsection{Corpus}\label{corpus}}

Following Yu et al. (2016), we selected the British National Corpus
(BNC) for analysis (British National Corpus Consortium, 2007). The
British National Corpus is \textasciitilde{}100 million word corpus
consisting of spoken (10\%) and written (90\%) English from the late
20th Century.

\hypertarget{pre-processing}{%
\subsection{Pre-processing}\label{pre-processing}}

We began the XML version of the corpus, and used the
\texttt{justTheWords.xsl} script provided along with the corpus to
produce a text file with one sentence of the corpus on each line.
Compound words (like ``can't'') were combined, and all words were
converted to lowercase before analysis. This produced a corpus of just
over six million utterance of varying lenghts. From these, we excluded
utterances that were too short to allow for reasonable estimation of
information shape (fewer than 5 words), and utterances that were
unusually long (more than 45 words). This exclusion left us with 89.83\%
of the utterances (Fig \ref{fig:bnc-lengths}.

\begin{CodeChunk}

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{estimating-information}{%
\subsection{Estimating information}\label{estimating-information}}

To estimate how information is distributed across utterances, we
computed the lexical surprisal of each word under two different models
(Levy, 2008; Shannon, 1948). Intuitively, the surprisal of a word is a
measure of how unexpected it would be to read that word, and thus how
much information it contains. First, following Yu et al. (2016), we
estimated a unigram model which considers each word independently,
asking how unexpected that word would be in the absence of any context:
\(\text{surprisal}(\text{word}) = -\log P(\text{word})\). This unigram
surprisal measure is a direct transformation of the word's frequency and
thus less frequent words are more surprising.

Second, we estimated a trigram model in which the surprisal of a given
word (\(w_i\)) encodes how unexpected it is to read it after reading the
prior two words (\(w_{i-1}\) and \(w_{i-2}\)):
\(\text{surprisal}(w_{i}) = -log P(w_i|w_{i-1},w_{i-2})\). This metric
encodes the idea that words that are low frequency in isolation (e.g.
``meatballs'') may become much less surprising in certain contexts (e.g.
``spaghetti and meatballs'') but more surprising in others (e.g.
``coffee with meatballs''). In principle, we would like to encode the
surprisal of a word given all of the prior sentential context
(\(\text{surprisal}(w_{i}) = -P(w_i|w_{i-1}w_{i-2}...w_{1})\). However,
the difficulty of correctly estimating these probabilities from a corpus
grow combinatorically with the number of prior words, and in practice
trigram models perform well as an approximation (see e.g. Chen \&
Goodman, 1999; Smith \& Levy, 2013).

\hypertarget{model-details}{%
\subsubsection{Model details}\label{model-details}}

We estimated the surprisal for each word type in the British National
Corpus using the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, Pouzyrevsky, Clark, \& Koehn,
2013). Each utterance was padded with a special start-of-sentence word
``\(\left<s\right>\)'' and end of sentence word ``\(\left</s\right>\)''.
Trigram estimates did not cross sentence boundaries, so for example the
surprisal of the second word in an utterances was estimated as
(\(\text{surprisal}(w_{2}) = -P(w_2|w_{i},\left<s\right>)\).

Naïve trigram models will underestimate the surprisal of words in
low-frequency trigrams (e.g.~if the word ``meatballs'' appears only once
in the corpus following exactly the words ``spaghetti and'', it is
perfectly predictable from its prior two words). To avoid this
underestimation, we used modified Kneser-Ney smoothing which discounts
all ngram frequency counts--reducing the impact of rare ngrams on
probability calculations--and interpolates lower-order ngrams into the
calcuations. These lower-order ngrams are weighted according to the
number of distinct contexts they occur as a continuation (e.g.
``Francisco'' may be a common word in a corpus, but likely only occurs
after ``San'' as in ``San Francisco'', so it receives a lower weighting;
see Chen \& Goodman, 1999).

\hypertarget{averaging-curves}{%
\subsubsection{Averaging curves}\label{averaging-curves}}

To develop a characteristic information curve for sentences in the
corpus, we needed to aggregate sentences that varied dramatically in
length (Fig \ref{bnc-lengths}). We used Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter
Averaging (DBA), an algorithm for finding the average of sequences that
share and underlying pattern but vary in length (Petitjean, Ketterlin,
\& Gançarski, 2011). DBA is an extension of standard Dynamic Time
Warping, which searches for an invariant template in shifted and
stretched instances of that template {[}e.g.~all instances of the vowel
`a' in acoustic recordings of a speaker's productions even if the
instances vary in their duration and intensity{]}. DBA inverts this
idea, discovering a latent invariant template from a set of sequences.

We used DBA to discover the short sequence of surprisal values that
characterized the surprisal curves common to sentences of varying
sentence lengths. We first averaged individual sentences of the same
length together, and then applied the DBA algorithm to this set of
average sequences. DBA requires a parameter specifying the length of the
template sequence. We chose 5 as the length of the template sequence
based on our inspection of the curves from the British National Corpus
as well as the curves we found in subsequent studies. However, the
results of this and the following studies were robust to other choices
of this length parameter (7 and 10).

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

We replicate ({\textbf{???}}) et al.'s (2016) result using the surprisal
metric in place of the entropy metric. We use the frequency-based or
``contextless'' surprisal metric, which determines the average
distribution of information based on word frequencies in a corpus. A
priori we expect that the frequency-based metric will produce a flat
distribution of information across word positions in the BNC. We find
the same frequency-based information trajectory as Yu et al.~with little
information in the first words of utterances and the most information in
the final word, see Figure \ref(fig:bncunigrams).

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[tb]
\includegraphics{figs/bncunigrams-1} \caption[BNC and Switchboard frequency-based trigram curves]{BNC and Switchboard frequency-based trigram curves}\label{fig:bncunigrams}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

We now include two words of context (trigrams) for each word in our
measurements. We observe a flattening effect of context for both spoken
and written English. After the first word or two, where the listener
does not have access to prior context, then they decode information at a
flat and more or less uniform rate. The contextual information curves
for the BNC and Switchboard are in Figure @ref(fig:bnctrigrams). We also
computed bigram curves with one word of context for each prediction:
these bigram curves resemble the trigram curves.

\hypertarget{experiment-2-english-in-other-contexts}{%
\section{Experiment 2: English in Other
contexts}\label{experiment-2-english-in-other-contexts}}

\includegraphics{figs/spoken-lengths-1} \caption[Sentence length distributions in the Spoken Language Corpora]{Sentence length distributions in the Spoken Language Corpora}\label{fig:spoken-lengths}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

We now turn to developmental data, and show that frequency-based
information curves characterize child speech from the time a child first
begins speaking as well as adult speech, regardless of utterance length.

We compare this result to the one for the Santa Barbara corpus of spoken
American English (Du Bois, Chafe, Meyer, Thompson, \& Martey, 2000).

We're going to examine child and child-directed speech from CHILDES
(MacWhinney, 2000) to capture the developmental picture. We use corpora
for Spanish, German, French, Mandarin Chinese and Japanese as well as
English. Mandarin and Japanese are not natively written using the Latin
alphabet, and moreover words are not segmented in their native scripts.
Instead of the native scripts, we use transliterations from the corpus
for each of the Mandarin and Japanese utterances into pinyin for
Mandarin and romanji for Japanese. In these transliterations, words are
previously segmented.

We observe a distinct and characteristic frequency-based information
trajectory for each language, robust across each utterance length. We
see the same distribution of information for both parents and children.
The parent often has more information on average at each word position
in their utterances. This is an effect of the surprisal metric: parents
speak more utterances than their children in most of the corpora, which
inflates the number of tokens they use and increases the surprisal of
hearing a rare word. We include the frequency-based information curve
from the North American English CHILDES collection for comparison. See
Figure~@ref(fig:childesunigrams)

For the trigram information curves, we see the same contextual smoothing
effect as in English. While the frequency-based information curves may
depend based on the language, the contextual information curves show the
same trajectory cross-linguistically. Using more than two words of
context is difficult for parent-child speech corpora because the
utterances are so short on average (less than \(10\) words). Based on
our results from the CHILDES collections, we hypothesize that the
frequency-based information curves may vary based on the genealogy and
typology of the languages in question. However, this does not extend to
the information curves with two words of context in particular, where
all languages we have seen so far are characterized by the same
information distribution. See Figure @ref(fig:childestrigrams).

For our next experiment, we will use typological, top-down features of
each language to predict the shape of its information curve.

\hypertarget{experiment-3-large-scale-data-and-linguistic-features}{%
\section{Experiment 3: Large-scale data and linguistic
features}\label{experiment-3-large-scale-data-and-linguistic-features}}

We pulled corpora for \(159\) diverse languages from Wikipedia, each of
which had at least \(10,000\) articles. To compare languages more
rigorously, we used two databases of language similarity features. To
target lexical differences between languages, we used the \(40\)-item
Swadesh list (Swadesh, 1955), retrieved from the ASJP database (Wichmann
et al., 2016). The Swadesh list is a well-known method for comparing
lexical similarity between languages, by quantifying the similarity
between the words on the list for pairs of languages, and is often used
to compare genetic relationships between languages. We computed the
average normalized Levenshtein distance, a string edit distance measure
(LDN; Holman et al., 2008) between each pair of our Wikipedia languages.

As our surprisal metric is a lexical measure, we expect the Levenshtein
distance to be high. To describe more structural relationships, we used
the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS; Dryer \& Haspelmath, 2013)
to describe the morphology, syntax, phonology, etymology and
semantics--in short the structures in each language. As WALS is a
compiled database from dozens of papers from different authors, most of
the features and languages are fairly sparse. We use a iterative
imputation algorithm for categorical data Multiple Imputation Multiple
Correspondence Analysis (MIMCA; Audigier, Husson, \& Josse, 2017) to
fill in the missing features.

We see no correlation between WALS features and cosine distances between
information curves.

We see no correlation between average normalized edit distances between
strings in two languages and cosine distances between information
curves.
