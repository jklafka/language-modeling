\begin{abstract}
What role does communicative efficiency play in how we organize our
utterances? In this paper, we present a novel method of examining how
much information speakers in a given language communicate in each word,
surveying numerous diverse languages. We find that speakers produce
frequent and informative words at regular parts of their utterances,
depending on language they use. The information distribution for each
language is derived in part from the features and genealogy of the
language. This robust information distribution characterizes both spoken
and written communication, and emerges in children's earliest
utterances. However, in real-time communication, in-context word
predictability allows listeners to process information at a constant,
optimal rate, regardless of the information distribution in the language
they understand.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

We can use language for a number of diverse yet useful purposes, such as
greeting friends, making records and signaling group identity. All of
these tasks share a common unifying purpose: changing the mental state
of the listener or reader through the information we transmit to them
(Austin, 1975). Language can naturally be thought of as a code, one that
allows speakers to turn their intended meaning into a message that can
be transmitted to a listener or reader, and subsequently converted by
the listener back into an approximation of the intended meaning
(Shannon, 1948).

Beyond its utility as a metaphor, this coding perspective on language is
powerful as a framework for rational analysis. If language has evolved
to be a code for information transmission, its structure should reflect
this process of optimization (Anderson \& Milson, 1989). The optimal
code would have to work with two competing pressures: (1) for listeners
to easily and successfully decode messages sent by the speaker, and (2)
for speakers to easily code their messages and transmit them with
minimal effort and error. A fundamental constraint on both of these
processes is the linear order of spoken language: sounds are produced
one at a time and each is unavailable perceptually once it is no longer
being produced.

Listeners use a strategic solution which allows them to interpret words
in rapid succession: \emph{incremental processing}. People process
speech continuously as it arrives, predicting upcoming words and
building expectations about the likely meaning of utterances in
real-time rather than at their conclusion (Kutas \& Federmeier, 2011;
Pickering \& Garrod, 2013; Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard, \&
Sedivy, 1995). Since prediction errors can lead to severe processing
costs and difficulty integrating new information on the part of
listeners, speakers should seek to minimize prediction errors. However,
the cost of producing more predictable utterances is using more words.
Thus, the optimal strategy for speakers seeking to minimize their
production costs is to produce utterances that are just at the
prediction capacity of listeners without exceeding this capacity (Aylett
\& Turk, 2004; Genzel \& Charniak, 2002). In other words, speakers
should maintain a constant transmission of information, with the optimal
rate of information transfer as close to the listener's fastest decoding
rate as possible.

Previous research has shown evidence for optimal coding at the word
(Piantadosi, Tily, \& Gibson, 2011) and phrasal (Jaeger \& Levy, 2007)
levels, among others. Genzel \& Charniak (2002) found a specific
information trajectory at the level of sentences in paragraphs: a
constantly increasing and nearly linear rate of information
transmission. Speakers have cognitive control over the speed at which
they say a word and whether or not they insert complementizers. But
speakers do not have control over the broad properties of their language
such as canonical word order that affect the organization of utterances
top-down. Does this whole-utterance level follow the predictions of
optimal coding? The utterance level may show strong effects of variation
between languages, as specific languages have properties that constrain
how speakers may form utterances in those languages, such as canonical
word order. These properties vary widely from language to language.

Previous work (Yu, Cong, Liang, \& Liu, 2016) studied this
within-sentence level only in written English, finding an unexpected
three-step distribution regardless of sentence length: little
information in the first words of sentences and the most information in
the final word. The the distribution found was robustly different from
the linearly increasing trend in sentences from Genzel \& Charniak
(2002), and also did not resemble the uniform distribution of
information that one might expect from a communicative efficiency
account, in which each word has approximately equal information close to
the channel capacity.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for modeling prototypical
information structure in a language. We compute a unique information
distributions for each language arising from word frequency. We find
that this information distribution characterizes all data within a given
language, both spoken and written, from the time child speakers
pronounce their first utterances. We link the information curves within
language families to their structures such as morphology and syntax,
such that the information curve can be partially predicted by the
features of the language. When considering communication and predictive
processing, listeners decode language at the same constant and optimal
rate regardless of language. Previous uniform information density work
has focused on English, but we analyze well over a hundred diverse
languages from across the world and from a variety of language families.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

We build a statistical model of a fluent listener: how much information
do you tend to decode at each part of an utterance in a language? We
begin by approximate language experience and linguistic knowledge by
training on a corpus. We test on the same corpus to approximate the
listener's real-time experience, avoiding overfitting by smoothing. We
compute the prototypical information distribution over all sentences in
the corpus.

\hypertarget{surprisal}{%
\subsubsection{Surprisal}\label{surprisal}}

Shannon (1948) defined information as ``the reduction in uncertainty
about one variable given that the value of another variable is known''.
The \emph{lexical surprisal} (Levy, 2008) metric applies Shannon's
definition of information to words. This measure defines the information
in a word as the predictability of the word based on previously heard or
seen words in its context, as in the formula below. The surprisal of a
word is inversely proportional to the predictability of that word, such
that less common and less predictable words carry more information.
Frequency is intimately tied rto information content in words, with much
of the differences between word frequencies being explained by
information content cross-linguistically (Piantadosi et al., 2011).

\[\text{surprisal}(\text{word}) = -\log P(\text{word})\]

\hypertarget{incorporating-context}{%
\subsubsection{Incorporating context}\label{incorporating-context}}

However, when reading or listening, people don't just consider each word
as an isolated linguistic signal. Instead, listeners use the words they
have already heard to predict and decode the word they are currently
hearing. Following this incremental processing paradigm, we can also
condition the surprisal of a word in its context. In the formula below,
\(w_i\) denotes the word currently being read or heard, while
\(w_{i-1}\) denotes the first word before the current word, \(w_{i-2}\)
denotes the second word before the current word, and so on.

\[\text{surprisal}(w_i|w_{i-1}w_{i-2}...) = -log P(w_i|w_{i-1}w_{i-2}...)\]

When we use a word or two of context in our surprisal calculations, then
the set of reasonable final items in our ngrams is greatly restricted.
For example, in the sentence ``I take my coffee with cream and sugar'',
when hearing ``cream and'', a listener might automatically predict
``sugar'', but there are few possible continuations with even the two
words ``cream and''. This is linked to the N400 component in
neurological processing (Kutas \& Federmeier, 2011).

Ideally, we would like to measure the predictability of each word in an
utterance using all of the information available to that word. For
example, in an utterance of twenty words, we would like to use the
previous \(19\) words of context to predict the \(20\)th word. However,
we would need to train on a corpus of many trillion word tokens to
predict with this amount of context. Regardless of computational
constraints, we want to directly compare how predictable each word is
regardless of its position in an utterance. We therefore use a
simplifying \emph{Markov assumption}: we condition our next predictions
on a fixed-size context window instead of all preceding words.

\[\text{surprisal}(w_i|w_{i-1}w_{i-2}...) \approx \text{surprisal}(w_i|w_{i-1}w_{i-2})\]

We train two types of ngram language models independently on a corpus.
One of our models is frequency-based: we do not incorporate context into
our surprisal calculations. To incorporate context into our models, we
train bigram and trigram language models, which incorporate one and two
words of context for each processed word, respectively. Although these
models may seem to use an inconsequential amount of context when
predicting the next word, bigram and trigram models introduce a great
deal of improvement over unigram models across tasks (Chen \& Goodman,
1999). Models which incorporate more than two words of context have
issues with overfitting to the corpus and only predicting observed
sequences, often generalizing poorly.

\hypertarget{language-model-smoothing}{%
\subsubsection{Language model
smoothing}\label{language-model-smoothing}}

Once we have fitted our language model, we can compute the surprisal of
a continuation by simply taking the negative log-probability of that
word's ngram probability. To find the average information for a given
position in a corpus, we take all utterances of a given length, and for
each word position in utterances of that length, we compute the average
of the surprisals for all of the non-unique words that occur in that
position, conditioned or not conditioned on context.

To avoid overfitting our models to the corpus, we use modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing as implemented in the KenLM toolkit (Heafield,
Pouzyrevsky, Clark, \& Koehn, 2013). Briefly, this smoothing technique
discounts all ngram frequency counts, which reduces the impact of rare
ngrams on probability calculations, and interpolates lower-order ngrams
into the calcuations. These lower-order ngrams are weighted according to
the number of distinct contexts they occur as a continuation (e.g.
``Francisco'' may be a common word in a corpus, but likely only occurs
after ``San'' as in ``San Francisco'', so it receives a lower
weighting). For a longer explanation explanation of modified Kneser-Ney
smoothing and comparison to other ngram smoothing methods, see Chen \&
Goodman (1999).

\hypertarget{aggregating-time-sequences}{%
\subsubsection{Aggregating time
sequences}\label{aggregating-time-sequences}}

To aggregate across utterance lengths, we use the DTW barycenter
algorithm (Petitjean, Ketterlin, \& Gançarski, 2011). The dynamic time
warping (DTW) algorithm (Sakoe \& Chiba, 1978) compares time sequential
data, first used for speech recognition to unite stretched and shifted
sound patterns. This algorithm finds a prototypical time series given
variable length series. Something about length of barycenters.

The flexibility of the surprisal metric we employ in this paper allows
us to calculate the anticipated information for an individual utterance,
as most work with the metric has done in the past. Averaging together
the surprisal values for a word position within utterances is a step
further than prior work, and indicates the tendencies speakers gravitate
towards instead of examining individual stimuli in psycholinguistic
experiments.

\hypertarget{experiment-1-english-speech-and-writing}{%
\section{Experiment 1: English speech and
writing}\label{experiment-1-english-speech-and-writing}}

We first turn to working with written English in the British National
Corpus (BNC; Leech, 1992). The BNC is a collection of spoken and written
records (90\% written) from the turn of the century, intended to be a
representative sample of British English. Using their word entropy
metric without context, Yu et al. (2016) found a distinctive three-step
distribution for information in written English sentences in the corpus.
The first word tended to contain little information. While the middle
words of sentences each had more information than the first word, they
found a flat and non-increasing rate of information transmission across
the middle of sentences. The final word contained the most, though not
most, of the information out of any in the sentence, with a noticeable
spike in information. They found the same distribution across sentence
lengths, from sentences with \(15\) words to sentences with \(45\)
words.

We replicate the Yu et al. (2016) result using the surprisal metric in
place of the entropy metric. We use the frequency-based or
``contextless'' surprisal metric, which determines the average
distribution of information based on word frequencies in a corpus. A
priori we expect that the frequency-based metric will produce a flat
distribution of information across word positions in the BNC. We find
the same frequency-based information trajectory as Yu et al.~with little
information in the first words of utterances and the most information in
the final word, see Figure~@ref(fig:bncunigrams).

We compare this result with spoken English conversations from the
Switchboard telephone conversation corpus ({\textbf{???}}). The spoken
and written English corpora have the same information trajectory.

\begin{CodeChunk}

\includegraphics{figs/bncunigrams-1} \caption[BNC and Switchboard frequency-based trigram curves]{BNC and Switchboard frequency-based trigram curves}\label{fig:bncunigrams}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

We now include two words of context (trigrams) for each word in our
measurements. We observe a flattening effect of context for both spoken
and written English. After the first word or two, where the listener
does not have access to prior context, then they decode information at a
flat and more or less uniform rate. The contextual information curves
for the BNC are in Figure @ref(fig:bnctrigrams). We also computed bigram
curves with one word of context for each prediction: these bigram curves
resemble the trigram curves.

\includegraphics{figs/bnctrigrams-1} \caption[BNC and Switchboard context-based trigram curves]{BNC and Switchboard context-based trigram curves}\label{fig:bnctrigrams}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

We now turn to developmental data, and show that frequency-based
information curves characterize child speech from the time a child first
begins speaking as well as adult speech, regardless of utterance length.

\hypertarget{experiment-2-child-and-child-directed-speech}{%
\section{Experiment 2: Child and child-directed
speech}\label{experiment-2-child-and-child-directed-speech}}

We're going to examine child and child-directed speech from CHILDES
(MacWhinney, 2000) to capture the developmental picture. We use corpora
for Spanish, German, French, Mandarin Chinese and Japanese as well as
English. Mandarin and Japanese are not natively written using the Latin
alphabet, and moreover words are not segmented in their native scripts.
Instead of the native scripts, we use transliterations from the corpus
for each of the Mandarin and Japanese utterances into pinyin for
Mandarin and romanji for Japanese. In these transliterations, words are
previously segmented.

We observe a distinct and characteristic frequency-based information
trajectory for each language, robust across each utterance length. We
see the same distribution of information for both parents and children.
The parent often has more information on average at each word position
in their utterances. This is an effect of the surprisal metric: parents
speak more utterances than their children in most of the corpora, which
inflates the number of tokens they use and increases the surprisal of
hearing a rare word. We include the frequency-based information curve
from the North American English CHILDES collection for comparison. See
Figure~@ref(fig:childesunigrams)

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[tb]
\includegraphics{figs/childesunigrams-1} \caption[CHILDES frequency-based trigram curves]{CHILDES frequency-based trigram curves}\label{fig:childesunigrams}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

English, Spanish, French and German feature similar information curve
shapes, with slight variations. The German information curve features
lower information for longer towards the beginnings of utterances,
possibly due to the grammatical restriction that the second word in
German utterances must be a verb (V2). Spanish features a larger spike
in the amount of information in the final word of utterances. For
Japanese and Mandarin, we observe completely different frequency-based
information curve trajectories. The Japanese frequency-based information
curve trajectory begins high and finishes low, the mirror image of the
German and Romance language information curves. The Mandarin curve
begins low and finishes low, but features high information in the middle
of utterances. We hypothesize this may be due to Japanese and Mandarin
speakers typically ending their utterances with particles, which are
common and thus contain little information on their own.

For the trigram information curves, we see the same contextual smoothing
effect as in English. While the frequency-based information curves may
depend based on the language, the contextual information curves show the
same trajectory cross-linguistically. Using more than two words of
context is difficult for parent-child speech corpora because the
utterances are so short on average (less than \(10\) words). Based on
our results from the CHILDES collections, we hypothesize that the
frequency-based information curves may vary based on the genealogy and
typology of the languages in question. However, this does not extend to
the information curves with two words of context in particular, where
all languages we have seen so far are characterized by the same
information distribution. See Figure~@ref(fig:childestrigrams).

\end{CodeChunk}

To make a claim about how languages on a larger scale, we need to use
larger corpora and a much larger number of languages.

\hypertarget{experiment-3-large-scale-data-and-linguistic-features}{%
\section{Experiment 3: Large-scale data and linguistic
features}\label{experiment-3-large-scale-data-and-linguistic-features}}

We pulled corpora for \(159\) diverse languages from Wikipedia, each of
which had at least \(10,000\) articles. To compare languages more
rigorously, we used two databases of language similarity features. To
target lexical differences between languages, we used the \(40\)-item
Swadesh list (Swadesh, 1955), retrieved from the ASJP database (Wichmann
et al., 2016). The Swadesh list is a well-known method for comparing
lexical similarity between languages, by quantifying the similarity
between the words on the list for pairs of languages, and is often used
to compare genetic relationships between languages. We computed the
average normalized Levenshtein distance, a string edit distance measure
(LDN; Holman et al., 2008) between each pair of our Wikipedia languages.

As our surprisal metric is a lexical measure, we expect the Levenshtein
distance to be high. To describe more structural relationships, we used
the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS; Dryer \& Haspelmath, 2013)
to describe the morphology, syntax, phonology, etymology and
semantics--in short the structures in each language. As WALS is a
compiled database from dozens of papers from different authors, most of
the features and languages are fairly sparse. We used a iterative
imputation algorithm for categorical data Multiple Imputation Multiple
Correspondence Analysis (MIMCA; Audigier, Husson, \& Josse, 2017) to
fill in the missing features.

What did we learn from this? Unigrams vary kind of with features across
