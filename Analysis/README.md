# Scripts for analyzing how top-down features affect the shape of the barycenters

## Dendrogram
To run hclust_viz.py, use the following command

`python3 hclust_viz.py`

The program may automatically open the dendrogram in a tab of your browser. If not, simply copy and paste the server address (one of the traditional localhost addresses like 127.0.0.0).
